Task
You will be passed all the dice roll results, and your task is to write the code to return a string representing a histogram, so that when it is printed it has the same format as the example.

Notes
There are no trailing spaces on the lines
All lines (including the last) end with a newline \n
A count is displayed above each bar (unless the count is 0)
The number of rolls may vary but is always less than 100
